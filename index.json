However, the requirement of using words to describe a desired concept provides limited control over the appearance of the generated concepts. In this work, we address this shortcoming by proposing an approach to enable personalization capabilities in existing text-to-image diffusion models. We propose a novel architecture (BootPIG) that allows a user to provide reference images of an object in order to guide the appearance of a concept in the generated images.\nThe proposed BootPIG architecture makes minimal modifications to a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and utilizes a separate UNet model to steer the generations toward the desired appearance. We introduce a training procedure that allows us to bootstrap personalization capabilities in the BootPIG architecture using data generated from pretrained text-to-image models, LLM chat agents, and image segmentation models. In contrast to existing methods that require several days of pretraining, the BootPIG architecture can be trained in approximately 1 hour. Experiments on the DreamBooth dataset demonstrate that BootPIG outperforms existing zero-shot methods while being comparable with test-time finetuning approaches. Through a user study, we validate the preference for BootPIG generations over existing methods both in maintaining fidelity to the reference object's appearance and aligning with textual prompts.","tags":[],"title":"BootPIG: Bootstrapping Zero-shot Personalized Image Generation Capabilities in Pretrained Diffusion Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bram Wallace","Meihua Dang","Rafael Rafailov","Linqi Zhou","Aaron Lou","Senthil Purushwalkam","Stefano Ermon","Caiming Xiong","Shafiq Joty","Nikhil Naik"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1702109797,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702109797,"objectID":"49e361d3be006965c201e1e6b28924b3","permalink":"https://www.senthilpurushwalkam.com/publication/diffdpo/","publishdate":"2017-01-02T00:16:37-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/diffdpo/","section":"publication","summary":"Large language models (LLMs) are fine-tuned using human comparison data with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods to make them better aligned with users' preferences. In contrast to LLMs, human preference learning has not been widely explored in text-to-image diffusion models; the best existing approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model using carefully curated high quality images and captions to improve visual appeal and text alignment. We propose Diffusion-DPO, a method to align diffusion models to human preferences by directly optimizing on human comparison data. Diffusion-DPO is adapted from the recently developed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a simpler alternative to RLHF which directly optimizes a policy that best satisfies human preferences under a classification objective. We re-formulate DPO to account for a diffusion model notion of likelihood, utilizing the evidence lower bound to derive a differentiable objective. Using the Pick-a-Pic dataset of 851K crowdsourced pairwise preferences, we fine-tune the base model of the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)-1.0 model with Diffusion-DPO. Our fine-tuned base model significantly outperforms both base SDXL-1.0 and the larger SDXL-1.0 model consisting of an additional refinement model in human evaluation, improving visual appeal and prompt alignment. We also develop a variant that uses AI feedback and has comparable performance to training on human preferences, opening the door for scaling of diffusion model alignment methods.","tags":[],"title":"Diffusion Model Alignment Using Direct Preference Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Senthil Purushwalkam","Nikhil Naik"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1699517797,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699517797,"objectID":"c9a9b3a9be18ae341a46734d99994b73","permalink":"https://www.senthilpurushwalkam.com/publication/conrad/","publishdate":"2017-01-02T00:16:37-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conrad/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a novel method for reconstructing 3D objects from a single RGB image. Our method leverages the latest image generation models to infer the hidden 3D structure while remaining faithful to the input image. While existing methods  obtain impressive results in generating 3D models from text prompts, they do not provide an easy approach for conditioning on input RGB data. Naïve extensions of these methods often lead to improper alignment in appearance between the input image and the 3D reconstructions. We address these challenges by introducing Image Constrained Radiance Fields (ConRad), a novel variant of neural radiance fields. ConRad is an efficient 3D representation that explicitly captures the appearance of an input image in one viewpoint. We propose a training algorithm that leverages the single RGB image in conjunction with pretrained Diffusion Models to optimize the parameters of a ConRad representation.

As a result, SSL holds the promise to learn representations from data in-the-wild, i.e., without the need for finite and static datasets. Instead, true SSL algorithms should be able to exploit the continuous stream of data being generated on the internet or by agents exploring their environments. But do traditional self-supervised learning approaches work in this setup? In this work, we investigate this question by conducting experiments on the continuous self-supervised learning problem. While learning in the wild, we expect to see a continuous (infinite) non-IID data stream that follows a non-stationary distribution of visual concepts. The goal is to learn a representation that can be robust, adaptive yet not forgetful of concepts seen in the past. We show that a direct application of current methods to such continuous setup is 1) inefficient both computationally and in the amount of data required, 2) leads to inferior representations due to temporal correlations (non-IID data) in some sources of streaming data and 3) exhibits signs of catastrophic forgetting when trained on sources with non-stationary data distributions. We propose the use of replay buffers as an approach to alleviate the issues of inefficiency and temporal correlations. We further propose a novel method to enhance the replay buffer by maintaining the least redundant samples. Minimum redundancy (MinRed) buffers allow us to learn effective representations even in the most challenging streaming scenarios composed of sequential visual data obtained from a single embodied agent, and alleviates the problem of catastrophic forgetting when learning from data with non-stationary semantic distributions.","tags":null,"title":"The Challenges of Continuous Self-Supervised Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simone Parisi","Aravind Rajeswaran","admin","Abhinav Gupta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646611200,"objectID":"b1b2aeca1eb2246b7f16f8ba2878bcf7","permalink":"https://www.senthilpurushwalkam.com/publication/visualrepforrl/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/visualrepforrl/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent years have seen the emergence of pre-trained representations as a powerful abstraction for AI applications in computer vision, natural language, and speech. However, policy learning for control is still dominated by a tabula-rasa learning paradigm, with visuo-motor policies often trained from scratch using data from deployment environments. In this context, we revisit and study the role of pre-trained visual representations for control, and in particular representations trained on large-scale computer vision datasets. Through extensive empirical evaluation in diverse control domains (Habitat, DeepMind Control, Adroit, Franka Kitchen), we isolate and study the importance of different representation training methods, data augmentations, and feature hierarchies. Overall, we find that pre-trained visual representations can be competitive or even better than ground-truth state representations to train control policies.

However, they fail to capture viewpoint and category instance invariance which are crucial components for object recognition. Second, we demonstrate that these approaches obtain further gains from access to a clean object-centric training dataset like Imagenet.

In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods require hundreds of training examples for each possible category to build reliable and accurate classifiers. To alleviate this striking difference in efficiency, we propose a task-driven modular architecture for compositional reasoning and sample efficient learning. Our architecture consists of a set of neural network modules, which are small fully connected layers operating in semantic concept space. These modules are configured through a gating function conditioned on the task to produce features representing the compatibility between the input image and the concept under consideration. This enables us to express tasks as a combination of sub-tasks and to generalize to unseen categories by reweighting a set of small modules. Furthermore, the network can be trained efficiently as it is fully differentiable and its modules operate on small sub-spaces. We focus our study on the problem of compositional zero-shot classification of object-attribute categories. We show in our experiments that current evaluation metrics are flawed as they only consider unseen object-attribute pairs. When extending the evaluation to the generalized setting which accounts also for pairs seen during training, we discover that naive baseline methods perform similarly or better than current approaches. However, our modular network is able to outperform all existing approaches on two widely-used benchmark datasets.","tags":null,"title":"Task-Driven Modular Networks for Zero-Shot Compositional Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Abhinav Gupta","Danny Kaufman","Bryan Russell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555286400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555286400,"objectID":"22ae29d82b8bd06c4041677ac6c0ee41","permalink":"https://www.senthilpurushwalkam.com/publication/bouncelearn/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bouncelearn/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce an approach to model surface properties governing bounces in everyday scenes.

Most benchmarks are led by ensembles of these powerful learners, but ensembling is typically treated as a post-hoc procedure implemented by averaging independently trained models with model variation induced by bagging or random initialization. In this paper, we rigorously treat ensembling as a first-class problem to explicitly address the question: what are the best strategies to create an ensemble? We first compare a large number of ensembling strategies, and then propose and evaluate novel strategies, such as parameter sharing (through a new family of models we call TreeNets) as well as training under ensemble-aware and diversity-encouraging losses. We demonstrate that TreeNets can improve ensemble performance and that diverse ensembles can be trained end-to-end under a unified loss, achieving significantly higher \"oracle\" accuracies than classical ensembles.","tags":null,"title":"Why M Heads are Better than One: Training a Diverse Ensemble of Deep Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Cogswell","Xiao Lin","admin","Dhruv Batra"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1418601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1418601600,"objectID":"b1625c4698822e55584a7b42f1d3e93f","permalink":"https://www.senthilpurushwalkam.com/publication/gmcnn/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gmcnn/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a two-module approach to semantic segmentation that incorporates Convolutional Networks (CNNs) and Graphical Models. Graphical models are used to generate a small (5-30) set of diverse segmentations proposals, such that this set has high recall. Since the number of required proposals is so low, we can extract fairly complex features to rank them. Our complex feature of choice is a novel CNN called SegNet, which directly outputs a (coarse) semantic segmentation. Importantly, SegNet is specifically trained to optimize the corpus-level PASCAL IOU loss function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CNN specifically designed for semantic segmentation. This two-module approach achieves 52.5% on the PASCAL 2012 segmentation challenge.","tags":null,"title":"Combining the Best of Graphical Models and ConvNets for Semantic Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Baihua Li","Qinggang Meng","Jamie McPhee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1387065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1387065600,"objectID":"6f2484228bba00a8b92bbc67ac3ef792","permalink":"https://www.senthilpurushwalkam.com/publication/mriseg/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mriseg/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic segmentation of adipose tissue in thigh magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is challenging and rarely reported in the literature. To address this problem, we propose a fully automated unsupervised segmentation method involving the use of spatial intensity constraints to guide the segmentation process. The novelty of this method lies in two aspects: firstly, an adaptive distance classifier, incorporating intra-slice spatial continuity, is used for robust region growing and segmentation estimation; secondly, polynomial based intensity inhomogeneity maps are generated to model inter- and intra-slice intensity variation of each pixel class and thus refine the initial classification. Our experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of imposing 3D intensity constraints to successfully classify the adipose tissue from muscles in the presence of image noise and considerable amounts of non-uniform MRI intensity.","tags":null,"title":"Automatic Segmentation of Adipose Tissue from Thigh Magnetic Resonance Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ef97497db9d87643d1afa5c6f7ef03d6","permalink":"https://www.senthilpurushwalkam.com/personal/dogs/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/personal/dogs/","section":"personal","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"personal"}]
