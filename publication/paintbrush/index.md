abstract: "We present an augmented reality system for large scale 3D reconstruction and recognition in outdoor scenes. We use a purely passive stereo setup, allowing for outdoor use. In addition to producing a map of the 3D environment in real-time, it also allows the user to draw (or 'paint') with a laser pointer directly onto the reconstruction to segment the model into objects."
