abstract: "Individual neurons in CNNs implicitly learn semantically meaningful concepts ranging from simple textures and shapes to whole objects. We introduce an efficient zero-shot learning approach that learns to map domain knowledge about novel classes onto this dictionary of learned concepts and then optimizes for network parameters that can effectively combine these concepts. We also show how our approach can provide visual and textual explanations including neuron names."
