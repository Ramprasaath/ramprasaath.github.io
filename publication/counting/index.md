abstract: "We study the numerosity of object classes in natural, everyday images and build dedicated models for counting designed to tackle the large variance in counts, appearances, and scales of objects found in natural scenes. We propose a contextual counting approach inspired by the phenomenon of subitizing - the ability of humans to make quick assessments of counts given a perceptual signal, for small count values."
