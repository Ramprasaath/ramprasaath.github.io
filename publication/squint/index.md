abstract: "We investigate the capabilities of VQA models for solving tasks that differ in nature and in complexity. We notice that existing VQA models have consistency issues -- they answer complex reasoning question correctly but fail on associated low-level perception sub-questions. We quantify the extent to which this phenomenon occurs by creating a new Reasoning split and collecting Sub-VQA, a new dataset consisting of associated perception sub-questions needed to effectively answer the main reasoning question. Additionally, we propose SQuINT approach which enforces models be right for the right reasons."
